This project develops a classification model for mental disorders using a dataset in CSV format sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/cid007/mental-disorder-classification). It encompasses clinical and behavioral information from 120 samples, focusing on 17 critical symptoms to diagnose four mental health conditions: Bipolar Type-1 (Mania), Bipolar Type-2 (Depression), Major Depressive Disorder, and a control group of Normal Individuals. The 17 essential symptoms evaluated are Sadness, Exhaustion, Euphoria, Sleep Disorder, Mood Swings, Suicidal Thoughts, Anorexia, Anxiety, Attempted Explanation, Nervous Breakdown, Disregard & Move-On, Admitting Mistakes, Overthinking, Aggressive Response, Optimism, Sexual Activity, and Concentration.
